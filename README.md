### EU4 Country Picker
Windows Forms Application

I decided to develop the app, when we wanna start a new EU4 campaign with random countries.

* App takes the country table from [Wiki](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Countries), and [parse](Parse/HtmlTableParse.cs) it. 
* You can filter regions which ever you want to play.


### Dependencies

* HTML Agility Pack - *Nuget package I learned while developing the app.*


### Download
